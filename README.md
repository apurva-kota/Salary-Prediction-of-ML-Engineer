# Salary-Prediction-of-ML-Engineer

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the salary of a machine learning engineer based on various factors such as years of experience, skills, and location. The challenge is to provide insights for job seekers and recruiters to estimate salaries for specific job profiles and help employees make informed decisions.

## Solution
A regression model is employed to predict the salaries of potential job seekers based on their experience, skills, and geographic location. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains relevant features like salary, years of experience, AI/ML skills, and more.

## How I Approached It
- **Data Collection:** The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, which includes features like salary, years of experience, skills related to AI/ML, and job locations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I analyzed the data using various visualizations to gain insights into the relationships between different features.
- **Modeling:** A regression model was used to predict the salary of a job seeker based on input features such as skills, experience, and location.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Tools like **GeoPandas** and **Folium** were used to visualize job openings on an interactive map, showing location-based trends.

## What I Found
- A strong correlation between years of experience and salary.
- Specific skills related to AI/ML had a significant impact on the salary prediction.
- Geographic location played a crucial role in job availability and salary variance, with certain locations offering higher salaries.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict salaries based on multiple features. The geospatial analysis added an extra layer of insight, showing the geographical distribution of job opportunities. This analysis can aid job seekers in making more informed decisions based on their skills and desired location.
